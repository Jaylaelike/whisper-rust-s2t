# Frontend Services Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the frontend to a modern services-based architecture that integrates seamlessly with the backend queue system. This provides real-time updates, better error handling, and improved user experience.

## New Services Architecture

### Core Services

1. **Base API Service** (`/lib/services/base-api.ts`)
   - Centralized API communication with error handling
   - Automatic retry logic and timeout handling
   - Form data and JSON request support

2. **Queue Service** (`/lib/services/queue-service.ts`)
   - Real-time WebSocket connection management
   - Task submission (transcription and risk analysis)
   - Queue stats and task history retrieval
   - Automatic reconnection handling

3. **Unified Types** (`/lib/services/types.ts`)
   - Comprehensive type definitions matching backend
   - WebSocket message types
   - Task status and result types
   - Queue statistics types

### Custom Hooks

1. **useQueue Hook** (`/hooks/use-queue.ts`)
   - Centralized queue management
   - Real-time task monitoring
   - WebSocket event handling
   - Automatic data refreshing

2. **Queue Context** (`/contexts/queue-context.tsx`)
   - Global queue service provider
   - Shared service instance across components

## Migrated Components

### New Components

1. **UploadFormSimple** (`/components/upload-form-simple.tsx`)
   - Uses new queue service for task submission
   - Real-time progress tracking via WebSocket
   - Clean form handling without complex schema issues

2. **QueueProgressNew** (`/components/queue-progress-new.tsx`)
   - Real-time queue statistics
   - Task history with live updates
   - WebSocket-powered status changes

3. **TranscriptionsListNew** (`/components/transcriptions-list-new.tsx`)
   - Displays both queue tasks and database transcriptions
   - Risk analysis re-submission via queue service
   - Real-time task status updates

### Updated Pages

1. **Homepage** (`/app/page.tsx`)
   - Uses QueueProgressNew component
   - Better queue visibility

2. **Upload Page** (`/app/upload/page.tsx`)
   - Uses UploadFormSimple component
   - Improved upload experience

3. **Transcriptions Page** (`/app/transcriptions/page.tsx`)
   - Uses TranscriptionsListNew component
   - Integrated queue status display

4. **Transcription Detail Page** (`/app/transcriptions/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Supports both queue tasks and database transcriptions
   - Real-time task result updates
   - Better error handling and not-found states

## Key Improvements

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket connection for live task progress
- Automatic queue statistics updates
- Real-time transcription status changes

### Better Error Handling
- Retry logic for API calls
- Graceful WebSocket reconnection
- Clear error messages and states

### Unified API
- Single service for all queue operations
- Consistent error handling across components
- Type-safe API interactions

### Improved UX
- Progress indicators for long-running tasks
- Real-time feedback during uploads
- Better loading and error states

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Centralized API logic in services
2. **Reusability**: Shared hooks and contexts across components
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types
4. **Performance**: Real-time updates without constant polling
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features and endpoints

## Testing Status

- âœ… Frontend builds successfully
- âœ… Components compile without TypeScript errors
- âœ… Services architecture properly integrated
- ðŸ”„ End-to-end testing with backend pending

## Next Steps

1. Test the upload flow with real backend
2. Verify WebSocket connections
3. Test real-time updates across multiple browser tabs
4. Add more robust error recovery mechanisms
5. Consider adding offline support for better reliability
