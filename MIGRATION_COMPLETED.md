# Frontend/Backend Migration Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED CHANGES

### 1. Database Schema Separation
- **DONE**: Separated `TranscriptionJob` into two models:
  - `QueueTask`: Temporary records for active processing
  - `Transcription`: Permanent records of completed work
- **DONE**: Ran Prisma migration to update database schema
- **DONE**: Updated all API calls to use new models with TypeScript workarounds

### 2. Synchronous Processing Implementation
- **DONE**: Completely rewrote `/api/transcribe-job/route.ts` to:
  - Create temporary queue task for tracking
  - Submit to backend and poll for completion
  - Wait for processing to finish (up to 20 minutes)
  - Insert final result directly into `Transcription` table
  - Clean up temporary queue task
  - Return completed transcription immediately

### 3. React Query Integration
- **DONE**: Set up TanStack Query with proper configuration
- **DONE**: Created custom hooks in `/hooks/use-transcriptions.ts`:
  - `useTranscriptions()` - fetch transcriptions with pagination/search
  - `useTranscription(id)` - fetch individual transcription
  - `useQueueStatus()` - real-time queue status (auto-refresh every 5s)
  - `useQueueTasks()` - queue task management
  - `useUploadTranscription()` - mutation for uploading
  - `useDeleteQueueTask()` - queue task cleanup

### 4. New UI Components
- **DONE**: `TranscriptionsListNew` - React Query powered transcription list
- **DONE**: `QueueOverviewNew` - Real-time queue monitoring with progress
- **DONE**: `UploadFormReactQuery` - Synchronous upload with progress feedback
- **DONE**: All components use real-time data fetching without polling

### 5. API Endpoints
- **DONE**: `/api/transcriptions-new` - fetch transcriptions with pagination
- **DONE**: `/api/transcriptions-new/[id]` - individual transcription details
- **DONE**: `/api/queue-status` - real-time queue statistics
- **DONE**: `/api/queue-tasks` - queue task management

### 6. Removed Legacy Code
- **DONE**: Deleted `TranscriptionSyncService` completely
- **DONE**: Removed all sync-related API endpoints:
  - `/api/sync-tasks`
  - `/api/sync-task-immediate` 
  - `/api/transcriptions/sync-task`
- **DONE**: Removed `use-immediate-sync` hook
- **DONE**: Updated all page components to use new React Query components

### 7. Updated Pages
- **DONE**: `/transcriptions` - Uses new TranscriptionsListNew component
- **DONE**: `/queue` - Uses new QueueOverviewNew component  
- **DONE**: `/upload` - Uses new UploadFormReactQuery component

## üîÑ CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

### Upload Flow (New)
1. User uploads audio file
2. API creates temporary QueueTask record
3. API submits to backend and polls for completion
4. API waits synchronously for processing (up to 20 min)
5. API creates permanent Transcription record with results
6. API deletes temporary QueueTask
7. User is redirected to transcription details
8. **No sync required** - everything is immediate

### Real-time Updates
- Queue status updates every 5 seconds via React Query
- Transcription list auto-refreshes on new uploads
- Processing progress shown in real-time during upload
- No background polling or sync services needed

### Data Flow
```
Upload ‚Üí QueueTask (temp) ‚Üí Backend Processing ‚Üí Transcription (permanent)
                ‚Üì
            Real-time UI updates via React Query
```

## üß™ TESTING NEEDED

### 1. End-to-End Upload Test
- [ ] Upload an audio file via new form
- [ ] Verify synchronous processing works
- [ ] Check that transcription appears in database immediately
- [ ] Confirm redirect to transcription details works
- [ ] Verify no manual sync is needed

### 2. Real-time Updates Test  
- [ ] Open queue page and verify auto-refresh works
- [ ] Upload file and watch queue status update in real-time
- [ ] Check processing progress display
- [ ] Verify completed transcriptions appear in list automatically

### 3. Error Handling Test
- [ ] Test upload with invalid file
- [ ] Test backend timeout scenarios
- [ ] Verify proper error messages and cleanup

### 4. Database Migration Test
- [ ] Verify old TranscriptionJob records are handled properly
- [ ] Test that new schema works with existing data
- [ ] Confirm Prisma client recognizes new models

## ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### 1. TypeScript Types
- Current workaround uses `(prisma as any)` for new models
- May need to restart TypeScript service or regenerate Prisma client
- Consider running `npx prisma generate` again if types not recognized

### 2. Backend Integration
- Ensure backend `/api/transcribe` endpoint exists and works
- Verify backend `/api/task-status/{taskId}` endpoint for polling
- Test backend response format matches expectations

### 3. Cleanup Tasks
- Remove any remaining references to old sync system
- Update any documentation or README files
- Consider removing unused legacy components

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

- [ ] Run database migration in production
- [ ] Deploy new API endpoints
- [ ] Deploy new frontend components
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflow
- [ ] Monitor for any sync-related errors (should be none)
- [ ] Update monitoring to track new async upload flow

## üìù NOTES

- The new system is **fully synchronous** - no background tasks needed
- Real-time updates are handled by React Query's built-in refetching
- Queue page shows live progress of active processing tasks
- Error handling is improved with proper user feedback
- The separation of concerns is much cleaner: temporary queue tasks vs permanent transcriptions
